# PeoPay Strategic Plan

***

#### **1. Overview** <a href="#id-1-overview" id="id-1-overview"></a>

This strategic plan outlines the roadmap for PeoPay’s development, pilot testing, and scaling, ensuring the platform achieves its mission of bridging decentralized finance (DeFi) and mobile money systems. It connects the vision from the **White Paper**, the incentive mechanisms from the **Dynamic Contribution Scoring (DCS) Framework**, and the sustainability outlined in the **Tokenomics Model** to create a comprehensive implementation strategy.
