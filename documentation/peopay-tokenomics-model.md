# PeoPay Tokenomics Model

***

#### **1. Overview** <a href="#id-1-overview" id="id-1-overview"></a>

PeoCoin (PEO) is the utility and governance token at the core of the PeoPay ecosystem. This document outlines the tokenomics model that ensures sustainability, incentivizes ecosystem participation, and aligns with PeoPay's long-term vision of financial inclusion. The model incorporates deflationary mechanisms, staking rewards, and milestone-based unlocks to maintain token value while driving growth.

#### **2. Total Token Supply** <a href="#id-2-total-token-supply" id="id-2-total-token-supply"></a>

* **Fixed Supply**: 1,000,000,000 PEO
* **Blockchain**: Polygon (initially) with planned cross-chain integrations.
* **Justification**:
  * Polygon’s low fees and high scalability ensure seamless transactions.
  * Future cross-chain bridges will expand PeoCoin’s accessibility and liquidity across other Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks.

#### **4. Grants, IDO, and IEO Allocation** <a href="#id-4-grants-ido-and-ieo-allocation" id="id-4-grants-ido-and-ieo-allocation"></a>

**4.1 Grants**

* **Tokens Allocated**: 50,000,000 PEO (5%)
* **Purpose**:
  * Secure funding from blockchain ecosystems (e.g., Polygon, Binance, Solana).
  * Support early-stage development and pilot programs in target regions.
* **Vesting & Unlock Criteria**:
  * Locked for 6 months post-grant approval.
  * Linear unlock over 12 months, contingent upon proof-of-utility (PoU) milestones (e.g., pilot program completion, technical upgrades).

**4.2 Initial DEX Offering (IDO)**

* **Tokens Allocated**: 50,000,000 PEO (5%)
* **Mechanism**:
  * **Dynamic Pricing (Bonding Curve)**: IDO begins at a base price (e.g., $0.05/PEO), with price adjustments based on demand.
  * Conducted on decentralized exchanges (e.g., QuickSwap, SushiSwap).
* **Liquidity Support**:
  * Proceeds will fund liquidity pools (e.g., PEO/USDC, PEO/MATIC).

**4.3 Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)**

* **Tokens Allocated**: 50,000,000 PEO (5%)
* **Mechanism**:
  * **Dutch Auction**: Ensures fair price discovery on centralized exchanges (e.g., Binance, KuCoin).
* **Purpose**:
  * Broaden exposure to retail and institutional investors.
  * Provide additional liquidity and trading options.

**5.1 Transaction Fee Payments**

* Users pay transaction fees in PEO and enjoy discounts:
  * **Bronze Tier**: 5% discount.
  * **Silver Tier**: 10% discount.
  * **Gold Tier**: 20% discount.
  * **Platinum Tier**: 30% discount.

**5.2 Staking and Yield**

* Stake PEO to earn rewards based on network performance and user engagement.
* Dynamic Contribution Scoring (DCS) tiers provide additional yield bonuses.

**5.3 Governance**

* Token holders can propose and vote on platform upgrades, treasury allocations, and fee structures.

#### **6. Deflationary Mechanisms** <a href="#id-6-deflationary-mechanisms" id="id-6-deflationary-mechanisms"></a>

To maintain long-term token value, PeoCoin incorporates several deflationary strategies:

**6.1 Fee Burning**

* A percentage of transaction fees paid in PEO is burned, permanently reducing supply.

**6.2 Penalty Burning**

* Tokens deducted via DCS penalties are burned, discouraging malicious behavior.

**6.3 Revenue Buybacks**

* A portion of platform revenue (e.g., transaction fees, merchant services) is allocated for buybacks and token burns.
